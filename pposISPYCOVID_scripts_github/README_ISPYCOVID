Description of PPOS in STHLM3 dataset (scripts and steps to follow): analysis were runned on tensor. Logs are available to know R versions and libraries versions.

- "00Functions_weibull_sim.R" contains the functionsto fit weibull models with brms and to simulate data coming from weibull models and to calculate the PPOS score.

==============================================================================

PHASE1/2/3 are all runned in the same script: 2 different scripts for MAIN ANALYSIS (no proportional hazard assumption, and modelling stratiefied over treatment arm) 
and SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (modelling with different priors on the treatment effect).

- MAIN ANALYSIS
"1_main_noPH.R" contains the code to run the main analysis (no proportional hazard assumption, and modelling stratiefied over treatment arm). 
Uses functions in "00Functions_weibull_sim" 

- SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
"2_sesitivity_PH.R" contains the code to run the sensitivity analysis (modelling with different priors on the treatment effect).
Uses funtions in "00Functions_weibull_sim"

- Fig1 of the manuscript is produced using: "3_sensitivity_plot.R"
