Description of PPOS in STHLM3 dataset (scripts and steps to follow): analysis were runned on tensor. Logs are available to know R versions and libraries versions.

  PHASE1: modelling
- "1_STHLM3_modelFit_total.R" for fitting models from different modelling strategy. 
Interanlly calls "1a_STHLM3_modelFit_PCH_AR1.R" and "1b_STHLM3_modelFit_brms.R" for fitting PCH and Weibull models respectively.

  PHASE2 and PHASE3: prediction and anlysis
- "2_STHLM3_pred&Analysis_total.R" for prediction and analysis repeatedly done for each modelling strategy and adding different numbers of extra follow-up time. 
Internally calls "2a_STHLM3_pred&analysis_pch.R" and "2b_STHLM3_pred&analysis_weibull.R" for prediction and analysis for each modelling strategy.

- Fig2 of the manuscript is produced using: "3_STHLM3_pred_Fig2.R"
